## The Three Modes

VIM operates in three distinct modes:

### 1. Normal Mode (Escape Mode)
- **Default mode** when opening a file
- Used for navigation and commands
- Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode from any other mode
- This is where you spend most of your time

### 2. Insert Mode
- Used for typing and editing text content
- Enter from Normal mode using various commands
- Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode

### 3. Command Mode (Colon Mode)
- Enter by typing `:` from Normal mode
- Used for file operations (save, quit, search/replace)
- Execute commands by pressing `Enter`

## Getting Started

### Opening Files
```bash
vim filename        # Opens existing file or creates new one

```

When you open a file, you're automatically in **Normal Mode**.

### Basic Workflow
1. **Open file**: `vim filename`
2. **Enter Insert mode**: Press `i` to start typing
3. **Edit your content**: Type your text
4. **Return to Normal mode**: Press `Esc`
5. **Save and quit**: Type `:wq` and press `Enter`

## Why VIM is Actually Easy

Once you understand the mode concept, VIM becomes very logical:
- **Normal mode**: Navigate and give commands
- **Insert mode**: Type text
- **Command mode**: File operations

The key insight is that VIM separates "navigating/commanding" from "typing text" - this separation makes it incredibly powerful and efficient once learned.

**Remember**: When in doubt, press `Esc` to return to Normal mode!
