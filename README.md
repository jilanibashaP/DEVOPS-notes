DevOps notes by Jilani Basha

This repository contains my personal notes and guides on DevOps concepts, including:

- Difference between Windows and Linux
- AWS Regions and Availability Zones
- Launching an EC2 instance
- Firewall and Authentication (Security Groups)
- Connecting to servers using Git Bash
- Linux User Basics (root vs normal users)

These notes serve as a quick reference for learning and practicing DevOps.
