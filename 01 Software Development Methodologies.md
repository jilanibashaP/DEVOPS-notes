# Software Development Methodologies

## Waterfall Method
A traditional, linear approach where each stage of development must be completed before the next begins.

-> whole product will released at the end.

### Key Phases
1. Requirements Analysis
2. System Design  
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

### When to Use
- Well-defined, stable requirements
- Regulatory/compliance projects
- Minimal expected changes

## Agile Methodology
A dynamic, iterative approach where development happens in sprints, allowing for frequent adjustments based on feedback.

### Core Process
- Sprint Planning → Development → Review → Retrospective
- Typical sprint duration: 1-4 weeks
- Continuous customer collaboration

### When to Use
- Evolving requirements
- Customer feedback is crucial
- Fast time-to-market needed

## DevOps
Combines the speed of Agile with operational focus for reliable deployments, ensuring quality and stability in the software delivery pipeline.

### Key Practices
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Automated Testing
- Monitoring and Logging

### When to Use
- Frequent deployments required
- High reliability needs
- Cloud-based applications

## Quick Comparison

| Method | Flexibility | Change Management | Delivery |
|--------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Waterfall | Low | Difficult | Single release |
| Agile | High | Embraced | Regular iterations |
| DevOps | High | Automated | Continuous |

## Getting Started

**Waterfall**: Define all requirements upfront → Design → Build → Test → Deploy

**Agile**: Form cross-functional team → Create backlog → Run sprints → Deliver incrementally  

**DevOps**: Set up CI/CD pipeline → Automate testing → Monitor production → Iterate
